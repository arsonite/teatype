*** This is the documentation for the asset 'Focus' ***

The Focus is the path your character walks on. You arenÂ´t restricted from being and using anything. But your focus will immensily support a specific way
your character evolves.

Focus is the one gameplay element that is all about fighting and weapons, while skills are overall skills for your character, with focus you can unlock active and passive fighting-skills, this includes easter egg moves like wearing a sword in your mouth and utilizing Zoros sword fighting from One Piece, rivaling Saitama from One Punch Man with the strength of your punches, even going as far as sending people flying and fighting with the sheath of your weapon to add points to your badass meter and intimidate enemies.

Before you gain any focus at all, which is unlocked at LVL 15, your only attack options are simple singular strikes that drain little stamina and have no effect on lethargy.
With Focus attacks, most moves drain a lot stamina and add or subtract from your lethargy.

Players can choose to invest focus either into skills, to upgrade them or into a paragon like system where you can spend focus to increase stats after the level cap for attributes (700)

The Paths:

Inner Strength (Unarmed)
  Armored Shell

  High Impact Force (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5/+6/+7/+8/+9/+10)
    Your punches (and if unlocked kicks) bear such a force behind them, that there is a 5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50% chance that the knockback is so strong, it sends the enemy flying. When an object is in the trajectory of the flight and the object is not destroyed in the process, it inflicts additional damage on the target. When it breaks it still inflicts damage, just not as great.

  Cleaving Greater Impact Force (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5)
    Requires: High Impact Force +10
    The chance of your punches (and if unlocked kicks) triggering a blowback is increased to 55/60/65/70/75%

  Strong Kick (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5)

  Heavy Fist (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5)

  Gods Fist (+1/+2)

  Strong Kick (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5)

  Heavy Kick (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5)

  Gods Kick (+1/+2)

Eagle Eye (Ranged)

Critter (Small Weapons)

(Two-Handed Weapon)

(Heavy Weapon)

(Weapon & Shield)

Ferocious Slashes (Swords)
  Strong Neck
    Allows the user to wear a weapon of his choice (except heavy weapons) in his mouth. This increases the number of attacks per round to 3. Wearing a weapon in your mouth increases your lethargy by 1. Strong neck also allows the user to automatically repel one random attack per fight, which afterwards temporarily increases your lethargy by another 1, until the fight ends.

  Santoryu: Sanzen Sekai
    Requires: Strong Neck
    A special move that allows the user to utilize 3 attacks at the same time. The critical chance is slightly increased.

  Nitoryu: Dai Gekken
    Requires: Strong Neck
    A special move that allows the user to utilize 2 attacks at the same time. The critical chance is increased.

  Ittoryu: Sishi Sonson
