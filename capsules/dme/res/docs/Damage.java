There is the special case of critical chance that supercedes 100%.
When this happens this opens up a new area of critical damage, since a critical chance of over 100% is necessary to land orange and red crits.
The critical chance at this point acts like a multiplier on top of your critical damage. A critical chance of over 300% allows the User to aquire the trait 'Death Reincarnated' which grants the ability to inflict the strongest attacks on the game, black crits.

Critical Chance Necessary/Critical Damage/Title

Grey		(0%)    (1.0)  Basic Damage
