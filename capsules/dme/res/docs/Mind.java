/* This is the documentation for the asset 'Mind' */

The more virtous your mind is, the more healthier it is. The more corrupt it is, the more you are near insanity. This can trigger some events and
your character might hear, feel or see something that isn't there. People generally tend to avoid the mentally unstable. Some NPCs might even refuse
to service you.
