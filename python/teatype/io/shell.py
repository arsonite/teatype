    Executes a shell command using the subprocess module.

    This method runs a shell command in a subprocess and returns the exit code of the command.
    It provides options to run the command with sudo, set the current working directory,
    pass environment variables, and specify a timeout for the command execution.

    Args:
        command (str): The shell command to be executed.
        sudo (bool): Whether to run the command with sudo privileges. Default is False.
        cwd (bool): Whether to set the current working directory for the command. Default is False.
        env (dict): A dictionary of environment variables to be passed to the command. Default is None.
        timeout (float): The timeout in seconds for the command execution. Default is None.

    Returns:
        int: The exit code of the completed process.
