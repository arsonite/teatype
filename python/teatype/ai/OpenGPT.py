# The goal of this class is to build a fully featured multi-modal AI assistant with almost the same
# capabilities as ChatGPT, but running locally on the user's machine.
# This includes:
# - Text generation (chat, code, etc)
# - Image generation (from text prompts)
# - Image understanding (captioning, OCR, etc)
# - Audio understanding (transcription, etc)
# - File understanding (parsing, summarization, etc)
# - Memory (short-term and long-term)
# - Tool use (web search, calculator, etc)
# - Agent capabilities (reasoning, planning, etc)
