        Returns the ANSI escape code associated with the enumeration member.

        This method overrides the default string representation of the Enum member,
        enabling it to be used directly in string formatting for colored terminal output.
        This way enums mimick how they are implemented in other languages like C++.
        
        Unfortunately (for good reasons), Python does not support operator overloading and inheritance of enums,
        so this function has to be implemented in every enum class that requires it.
